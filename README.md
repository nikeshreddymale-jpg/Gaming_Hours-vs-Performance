🎮 Impact of Gaming Hours on Performance – Data Analytics Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between gaming habits and user performance using a real-world styled dataset. The goal is to understand how daily and weekly gaming hours influence academic/work performance, productivity, sleep patterns, stress levels, and focus.

Using Python and data analytics techniques, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive meaningful insights about healthy and unhealthy gaming behavior.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 1000 user records with the following key attributes:

User_ID – Unique identifier for each user

Age – Age of the user

Gender – Gender of the user

Occupation – Student / Working Professional

Game_Type – Type of games played

Daily_Gaming_Hours – Average daily gaming time

Weekly_Gaming_Hours – Total weekly gaming hours

Primary_Gaming_Time – Preferred gaming time (Morning/Night/etc.)

Sleep_Hours – Average sleep duration

Stress_Level – Stress rating

Focus_Level – Focus level rating

Academic_or_Work_Score – Performance score

Productivity_Level – Productivity rating

Performance_Impact – Overall impact of gaming on performance

🎯 Project Objectives
